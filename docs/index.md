# Summer 2020 Reflection


## Summer Experiences 

During my time as a Summer Research Associate in the Holy Cross Classics Department, I had the opportunity to deeply examine three 11th century manuscripts of the Iliad, the Upsilon 1.1, the Venetus B, and the Burney 86, as part of the Homer MultiText Project. While working with the "Twins" manuscripts (the Upsilon 1.1 and the Venetus B), the team I worked with expanded the already partially edited corpora of these manuscripts. The Burney 86, however, has not been widely studied by the HMT Project, so our team was defining many of our own methods as we edited. Using Zoom and the Atom teletype feature, our team scattered across the country was able to collaborate on editing and analyzing the Iliad texts. 

## Continuing the Work 

The summer research experience provided many opportunities to teach explain topics to my peers in the Holy Cross research team and at the Homer MultiText Summer Experience over zoom. As someone who finds joy and satisfaction both in working with data and working with people, getting to practice my teaching skills, especially in this new virtual environment, was amazing! Going into the virtual world of the 2020-2021 academic year as a student leader, I am so glad I was able to practice these skills and I am looking forward to bringing them into Holy Cross' Manuscripts, Inscriptions, and Documents Club this fall.
